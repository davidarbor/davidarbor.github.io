            <p>“‘Biodiversity’ is the full complexity and variety of life, at all scales, from genetic diversity, up to species and even ecosystem diversity. So, we use the term "biodiversity conservation" to refer to attempts to conserve and any parts of this natural diversity” (Botanic Gardens Conservation International)

            </p>
            <p> Bio in the Bay is a resource website developed and run by a group of high school students from the Bay Area in California. We’ve noticed that the regional parks that surround our homes are held close to heart by many. Therefore, we found it appropriate to create a database for users to have the resources to both maintain the biodiversity that fuels the beautiful nature around us, and also be able to apply the information for influential decision-making processes like constructing new housing in ensuring that habitat destruction is minimal so these beloved species can thrive.

    <div id="tildenInfo">One of the District's three oldest parks, Tilden has been called the jewel of the system, and its recreational activities have become a happy tradition for generations of East Bay youngsters. From a carousel ride and a picnic to a swim at Lake Anza and a stroll through the Botanic Garden, Tilden has variety to delight everyone. Yet there are plenty of quiet places in Tilden's 2,079 acres to shelter the wildlife and preserve natural beauty.</div>
    <div id="redwoodInfo">A hidden redwood forest lies off Redwood Road just a few miles over the ridge from downtown Oakland. The forest's peaceful groves give little evidence of the park's bustling past – in the mid-1800s the area was the scene of extensive logging to supply building materials for the San Francisco Bay Area. The logging era has long since passed, and a stately forest of 150-foot coast redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) has replaced those cut down.</div>
    <div id="wildcatInfo">Wildcat Canyon Regional Park encompasses 2,427 acres along  the Wildcat Creek watershed and the surrounding hills and ridges. The park extends from the Tilden Nature Area above the Berkeley hills in the south to historic Alvarado Park at the north end in Richmond. It includes a significant portion of the paved Nimitz Way extending from Inspiration point in Tilden Regional Park. Easy access from the busy cities of the East Bay makes Wildcat Canyon a popular place for hikers, mountain bikers, equestrians, and those simply looking for a quiet place to spend an afternoon. Alvarado Park, with its historic stonework, provides picnic areas for large and small groups, a wonderful play area for children, and access to Wildcat Creek, all just steps from the busy streets of Richmond.</div>
    <div id="claremontInfo">Claremont Canyon Regional Preserve is nestled in the Berkeley and Oakland hills behind the historic Claremont Hotel. This scenic, 208-acre preserve protects two parcels of land located on both sides of upper Claremont Avenue. Panoramic Ridge rises steeply to the north, and Gwin Canyon extends south. In addition to East Bay Regional Park District land holdings in Claremont Canyon, other undeveloped portions in the upper canyon are managed by the University of California and the East Bay Municipal Utility District. The City of Oakland owns Garber Park, a 13-acre oak/bay woodland south of Claremont Avenue.</div>

    <div id="fungiProtect">Current threats to fungi include destruction of forests worldwide, fragmentation of habitat, changes in land use, pollution, anthropogenic climate change and over-exploitation of commercially attractive species. To fight these threats, don’t forage fungi in the forest, avoid fertilizer where possible and use native plants, maintain a sustainable lifestyle, and of course, support conservation by joining a fungi club or other conservation organization to learn more and contribute to protecting fungi. Also, volunteer with organizations that preserve habitat and help fungi and support legislation that protects species and their habitats.</div>
    <div id="plantsProtect">One in five of world's plant species at risk of extinction, and that can be mitigated by controlling fires has been proven to decrease biodiversity, rescuing threatened germplasm, and producing seeds for reintroduction, reinforcement, habitat restoration and management, and replanting trees and plant species. And of course, support conservation by joining a plant club or other conservation organization (like a botanical garden) to learn more and contribute to protecting plants. Also, volunteer with organizations that preserve habitat and help plants and support legislation that protects species and their habitats.</div>
    <div id="birdsProtect">Prevent bird collisions with your windows, learn local hunting laws, clean bird feeders, don’t buy illegally-caged birds, recycle,  support native plants and restore natural habitat, keep your distance, and of course, support conservation by joining a bird club or other conservation organization to learn more and contribute to protecting birds. Also, volunteer with organizations that preserve habitat and help birds and support legislation that protects species and their habitats.</div>
    <div id="animalsProtect">Mammals
        Request the help of governmental bodies, officials, and organizations to take a more active role in preservation, preserve habitats and resources like water, promote safe and ethical hunting, help minimize value of animal byproducts including meat, ivory, etc., and of course, advocate for conservation by joining a mammal club or other conservation organization to learn more. Also, support legislation that preserve habitats and protect mammals (from rodents to “big cat” species).
        Fish/Marine Mammals:
        Use the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch guides or free app to identify what sustainable options are available, always ask where and how the fish was caught to learn more about if it is sustainable, support local businesses and restaurants that have committed to only serving sustainable seafood, and of course, advocate for conservation by joining a marine life club or other conservation organization to learn more and contribute effectively to their conservation. Also, support legislation that preserve habitats and protect fish/marine mammals.
        Reptiles and Amphibians
        Factors that have been causing disruption to reptile/amphibian species include, in various regions, habitat alteration, pesticides/herbicides, introduction of non-native species (especially fish), disease, invasive species, and unsustainable commercial collecting. Only through coordinated planning by federal, state, and local governments, environmental organizations, scientists, and a concerned public can we hope to succeed in conserving the remarkably diverse herpetofauna of our North American deserts. And of course, advocate for conservation by joining a reptile/amphibian club or other conservation organization to learn more. Also, support legislation that preserve habitats and protect reptiles and amphibians.

        Invertebrates
        To support invertebrates, plant wildflowers, prevent habitat degradation and fragmentation caused by dams, water pollution, and reduced streamflow, plant forests with diverse tree species, and of course, support conservation by joining an invertebrate club or other conservation organization (like the Xerces Society) to learn more. Also, support legislation that protects invertebrate species and their habitats.
